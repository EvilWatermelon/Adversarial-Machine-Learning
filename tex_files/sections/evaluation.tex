\subsection{Case Study: Developing a SVM for traffic sign detection}

For the case study scikit-learn \cite{scikit-learn} and for preparation of the dataset in Python OpenCV2 have different function to load and resize images \cite{opencv_library}. In their work, Stallkamp et al. \cite{DBLP:conf/ijcnn/StallkampSSI11} built a mulit-category classification dataset. The mulit-category classification dataset contains german traffic signs for image classification. That mulit-category classification dataset uses the german traffic signs from a approx. 10 hours daytime video from different roads.
