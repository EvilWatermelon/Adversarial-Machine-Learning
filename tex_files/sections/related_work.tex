This chapter presents the relevant background knowledge and show approaches from other scientific paper.

\subsection{ISO/IEC 27004:2009}

This present thesis based the requirements of Risk measurement of ISO 27004, among other things. ISO 27004 is a international security standard from the ISO 27000 \cite{DBLP:conf/euspn/MeriahR19} family which guides on continious basis evaluation methods. The present ISO can be related with ISO 27001 or used as a standalone standard. In ISO 27001 it is declared as a requirement where the effectiveness must be measured of a Information Security Management System \cite{barabanov2011information}. The ISO 27004 standard specifies what to be measured, when the measurement is needed and types of measurement \cite{lundholm2011design}. Barabanov et al. \cite{barabanov2011information} and Tarnes \cite{tarnes2012information} describe in their works the different properties of ISO/IEC 27004:2009 for Risk measurement. Tarnes shows the information security measurement model which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:is_measurement_model}.

For this thesis the objects to be measured and the measurement are the important parts of the information security measurement model. The measurement method is the SMF which measure based on different properties that are derived from risk indicators that will be discussed in Subsection \ref{sec:risk_indicators}. The attributes in Figure \ref{fig:is_measurement_model} are the properties in the SMF.

\subsection{Approaches from Jakub Breier et. al and Paul Schwerdtner et. al}

This present thesis is divided into two approaches.
Jakub Breier et al. \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2012-04884} propose in their paper
different proposals to measure risks with different aspects. \\
Paul Schwerdtner et al. \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2011-04328} is the second approach of this thesis.

\subsection{Security risks in context of Machine Learning}

Xiao et al. \cite{DBLP:conf/sp/XiaoLZX18} evaluate the security risks in deep learning for common frameworks for example TensorFlow. Xiao et al. uses the framework sample applications along the
frameworks. One statement of Xiao et. al is that the named frameworks TensorFlow, Caffe and Torch are implemented with many lines of code which make them vulnerable for many security vulnerabilities
for example heap overflow or integer overflow. Xiao et. al work is only in context of deep learning e.g. only for neural networks.

\subsection{Risk assessment in context of Machine Learning}

Paul Schwerdtner et al. \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2011-04328} present in their
work a framework to evaluate ML model by input corrupted data. This thesis discuss
this paper as an approach to estimate where the SMF could be used for.

\subsection{Adversarial-Robustness-Toolbox}

For this thesis the technical framework Adversarial-Robustness-Toolbox (ART) \cite{art2018} is a main component. Nicolae et al. \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1807-01069} evaluate in their work the
technical framework ART. ART is a Python library that supports several ML frameworks for example TensorFlow and PyTorch to increase the defense of ML models. ART support 39 attacks and 29 defense'
functions. This thesis only focuses on the attack functions for poisoning attacks which will be discussed in Subsection\ref{sec:backdoor} more detailed. The backdoor attacks in the technical framework
ART are introduced by Gu et al. \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1708-06733}.

\subsubsection*{Backdoor Attacks}
Due to the rising amount of training data, human supervision to check trustworthiness is less possible. That exposes vulnerabilites in training datasets like backdoors. Backdoor attacks can cause far-
reaching consequences for example bypass critical authentication. In \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2003-03675} Salem et al. introduces dynamic backdoors to trigger (a secret pattern of neighboring
pixels) random patterns and locations to reduce the efficacy on identifying backdoors. Salem et al. discuss in their work three backdoors, Random Backdoor, Backdoor Generating Network and Conditional
Backdoor Generating Network.
Gu et al. show in their paper different backdoor attacks and do a case study with a traffic sign detection attack. The evaluated backdoors are a single pixel backdoor and a pattern backdoor. The single
pixel backdoor changes a pixel to a bright pixel and the pattern backdoor adds a pattern of bright pixels in an image. The implemented attacks from Gu et al. are single target attack and an all-to-all attack.
