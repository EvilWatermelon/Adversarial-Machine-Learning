\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Machine Learning (ML) is a constantly growing field and is essential for many innovative
applications such as highly-automated and autonomous driving. Resulting from this,
there is an increased need to maintain security. This thesis concentrates on risk
measuring in context of ISO 27001 which will be discussed in \ref{sec:relWork}. Risk
measuring is a part of risk assessment to help where investments are needed to
defend a system against attackers. \\ \\
This thesis explains and discuss' a conceptual and technical framework to measure
risks which is called Risk-Measurement-Framework (RMF).
