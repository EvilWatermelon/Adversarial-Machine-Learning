\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The ISO 27004 standard is very generalized. That makes it possible to design and implement frameworks which are not covered as a standard or intended to be.

\subsection{Future work}

The attack object should be splitted into different attack techniques because every attack technique has its own characteristics and different goals to achieve with it.
