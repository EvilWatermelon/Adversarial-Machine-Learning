The following table explains and declares terms that are used in this thesis for standartization. The order of the table is organized by declaring a term before its relation to other terms.

  \begin{tabular}{ |l|l|  }
    \hline
    \rowcolor{lightgray} Term & Description \\ [0.5ex]
    Machine Learning & Machine learning is a program that trains from \\
    & training sets a predictive model. \cite{google} \\
    & \\
    \hline
    Machine Learning model & A model is a representation of a machine learning program \\
    & that learned from the training sets. \cite{google} \\
    & \\
    \hline
    Threat & Security violation when an event could cause harm \cite{DBLP:journals/rfc/rfc4949} \\
    & \\
    \hline
    Attacker & An attacker is a person that tries to perform something \\
    & unintentionally with or without access to the \\
    & machine learning model \cite{bsi_glossar_2021} \\
    & \\
    \hline
    Risk & Risk is the combination between the frequency of damage and \\
    & the extent of damage. The damage is the difference between a \\
    & planned and unplanned result \cite{bsi_glossar_2021}. \\
    & \\
    \hline
    Measurement property & In the context of risk measurement \\
    & in this present thesis, properties should help to find \\
    & features to measure risks in a machine learning model. \\
    & \\
    \hline
    Measurement proposal & In the context of risk measurement \\
    & in this present thesis, proposals from approaches \\
    & of other scientific works are used. \\
    & With the previously declared measurement properties together, \\
    & this thesis uses their possibilities, so that the risk measurement \\
    & leads to the best possible results. \\
    & \\
    \hline
    Attacker's characteristic & Values and features of an attacker \\
    & that are summarized into a generic term and fulfill properties \\
    & to measure risks. \\
    & \\
    \hline

    \rowcolor{lightgray} Term & Description \\ [0.5ex]
    Attack characteristic & Raw data of a measured attack that can be \\
    & summarized in a generic term. This characteristics can fulfill \\
    & properties or mapped to find attacker's characteristics. \\
    & \\
    \hline
    Metric & In context of machine learning, a metric is a value that is \\
    & optimized  in a machine learning program \cite{google}. \\
    & In context of this thesis, metrics will be used often for \\
    & measuring risks. \\
    & \\
    \hline
    Vulnerability & A vulnerability is an error that cause security \\
    & relevant threats \cite{bsi_glossar_2021}. \\
