\label{sec:conFrame}

In contrast to Schwerdtner et al., the framework of this thesis concentrates on training, especially risk measurement before and during training of the ML model. The conceptual framework discusses and explains the design of the RMF. The RMF is a technical framework which measures risks of backdoor attacks and measures the attackers effort. \\ Referencing on this thesis approach from Biggio et al. \cite{DBLP:conf/icml/BiggioNL12} a security analysis for machine learning is that the attacker knows the ML model and can use the data from the data distribution platform. It is assumed for the RMF that the attacker knows the training data. This is an unrealistic assumption, but in real-world scenarios the attacker could use a surrogate training set instead, from the same data distribution platform which the developers use \cite{DBLP:journals/ml/BarrenoNJT10}.

\subsection{Using the standards for the risk measurement}
\label{sec:standard}

After the explained measures and measurement development based on ISO 27004 in section \ref{sec:relWork}, the next step is to map requirements into the RMF. This discussion what parts of them can be fulfilled and which parts can not fulfilled. That should show the process of risk measurement in the RMF. \\ \\
At first, starting with \ref{itm:a} - ''Defining the measurement scope'' where the organizations capabilites and resources define the initial scope. It starts by decisions of the management and can not be fulfilled by the RMF because that is an individual process specific for an organization and stands not in relation with the risk measurement of this thesis. The part defining internal and external stakeholder can not be fulfilled by the RMF but \cite{DBLP:conf/dexaw/SharpFG99} describe how to identify them.  \\ \\

As next \ref{itm:b} - ''Identifying an information need'' about the identification of an information need. The first activity of identifying the processes and examination of the ISMS can not be fulfilled of the RMF. The information need prioritization criteria like risk treatment can be fulfilled by the general riks measurement of the framework because all results are shown as transparent as possible. The organization's capabilities and resources criteria is individual for the organization and cannot be measured. The stakeholders as already mentioned at the beginning are not considered further, therefore the fourth activity drops out completely. The third activity can be also fulfilled by showing all results of the risk measurement in a document. Based on the third activity the RMF gives a document as an output which template is shown in appendix \ref{sec:template}. \\ \\
As in \ref{itm:c} described that objects and attributes are identified in the scope and context of an ISMS, the objects and attributes need to be related to ML metrics which are used to measure risks and calculate the final risk. The attributes, objects and measurement methods are described in the next subsections. The measurement results base on the risk indicators which are derived in each measurement method.\\ \\

\subsection{Characteristics of backdoor attacks}

After discussing and evaluating the standards for the risk measurement in the RMF this subsection explain how the risks of backdoor attacks are measured.

\subsection{Types of backdoor attacks}

The following backdoor attacks should represent what they can achieve when using them. Further, this subsection should show the basis of the backdoor attacks that are used in the RMF.

\subsubsection*{The theory behind the ART backdoor attacks}

\textit{PoisoningAttackBackdoor} and \textit{PoisoningAttackCleanLabelBackdoor} are the two backdoor attacks in the framework. Gu et al. \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1708-06733} explain \textit{PoisoningAttackBackdoor} attacks. The goal of this backdoor attack is to change their labels to a target label. This happens by attacking a random small selection of the training set and apply a backdoor trigger into the inputs \cite{turner2018clean}. Gu et al. show in their work different backdoor attacks and do a case study with a traffic sign detection attack. In their work, Gu et al. developed a neural network with a backdoor trigger. The evaluated backdoors are a single pixel backdoor and a pattern backdoor. The single pixel backdoor increase the brightness of a pixel and the pattern backdoor adds a pattern of bright pixels in an image. The implemented attacks from Gu et al. are Single Target attack and an All-to-All attack. Single Target attack use the single pixel backdoor by changing a label from a digit $i$ as a digit $j$. Gu et al. explained that the test data are not available for the attacker. The error rate for their Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is 0.05\%. The error rate with the backdoored images increases at most to 0.09\%. An All-to-All attack change a digit label $i$ to $i + 1$. After testing the All-to-All attack the originial ML have a error rate of 0.03\% while the ML with the backdoored image have an average error of 0.56\%. \\
In their work, Turner et al. \cite{turner2018clean} explain
\textit{PoisoningAttackCleanLabelBackdoor} attacks. Turner et al. show an approach for executing backdoor attacks by utilizing adversarial examples and GAN-generated data. The point where Turner et al. start is analyzing effectiveness of Gu et al. attack while a simple technique is applied for data filtering. Turner et al. discovered that the poisoned inputs are outliers and are clearly wrong from the human inspection side. The attack would be ineffective if its rely solely on poisoned inputs which are labeled correctly and evade such filtering. At this point Turner et al. created an approach that do poisoned inputs which appear plausible to humans. The inputs need small changes to make them harder while classify them but the original label must still remain plausible. This transformation is performed by a GAN-based interpolation and adversarial bounded pertubations. GAN-based interpolation takes each input into the GAN latent space \cite{DBLP:conf/nips/GoodfellowPMXWOCB14} and then interpolate poisoned samples to an incorrect class. Adversarial bounded pertubations uses a maximization method to maximize the loss of the pre-trained ML model on poisoned inputs while staying around the original input.

\subsubsection*{Additional backdoor attacks to increase the possible extent of damage}


\subsection{Finding the attacker's effort}

Subsection \ref{sec:threat} explained a formal threat model to find the attackers effort with high-level and low-level attributes where the low-level attributes are mapped to with the high-level attributes. At first this subsection will discuss which of the characteristics are useful to find the attackers effort for attacking a ML model. Regarding to the mapping between the attributes, the low-level attributes will be discussed at first.

\subsection{Using the formal threat model}

For the risk measurement the attacker's effort is important to evaluate how high or low the risk is for an ML model. In this subsection the research questions \ref{itm:rq5}, \ref{itm:rq6} are addressed in more detail. In reference to the research question \ref{itm:rq8} this threat model could be a possible method for the RMF to measure risks which will be proved in Section \ref{sec:evaluation}.
As in subsection \ref{sec:threat} explained the high- and low-level attributes have to be mapped to find the high-level attributes based on the low-level attributes.

\subsubsection*{The low-level attributes}

To find the attacker's effort there is a need to collect data which can be measured from every attack on a ML model. These data is classified and explained in Subsection \ref{sec:threat}. Doynikova et al. explained which data is required to meausre the low-level attributes.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The first requirement is a dataset which contains information about the attack actions against a ML model. The information must be based on the skills, resources, intention, and motivation of the attacker.
  \item The second requirment for the dataset is that everything is marked in such a way that the analysis shows which actions the attacker performed. But this requirement is more about having multiple attackers or the analysis accross multiple attackers.
\end{enumerate}

The low-level attributes will also be used to measure the extent of damage based on the collected data.
\subsubsection*{The high-level attributes}


\subsubsection*{Mapping the low-level with the high-level attributes}


\subsubsection*{Derivate the properties to machine learning}


\subsection{Risk indicators}
\label{sec:risk_indicators}

The RMF measure risks by so called risk indicators. Properties, threat models and proposals are the basis for the risk indicators. Breier et al. in subsection \ref{sec:approaches} present
proposals that are the approach for the proposals of the risk indicators. Doynikova et al. presents a formal threat model to find the attackers effort.

\subsubsection*{Properties, proposals and characteristics derived from classic IT security}


\subsubsection*{Correlations of the properties, proposals and characteristics}


\subsection{Evaluation methods for the measured risks}


\subsubsection*{Analyze the dataset for vulnerabilites}


\subsubsection*{Logging the execution of the attack}


\subsubsection*{Machine learning metrics for risk measurement}


\subsubsection*{Python plots}


\subsubsection*{Calculate the risks}

\subsection{The final design to implement the RMF}

The last point \ref{itm:g} of \ref{sec:standard} shows the needed information for an implementation plan. This subsection fulfill parts of this.
To measure the extent of damage there need to be an implementation of the low-level attributes. To get the attacker's effort another class should represent the measurement of the high-level attributes. These two classes need to be mapped.
