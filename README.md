# Adversarial-Machine-Learning
For my Masterthesis I programmed an example of an adversarial neural network.

# Installation
- To install this framework you need at first Python 3.7.*  
This allows you to install the [https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox](Adversarial-Robustness-Toolbox).  
That is the core of this framework.
