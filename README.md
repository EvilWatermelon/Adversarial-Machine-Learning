# Adversarial-Machine-Learning
For my Masterthesis I programmed an example of an adversarial neural network.

# Installation 💻
- To install this framework you need at first Python 3.7.*  
This allows you to install the [Adversarial-Robustness-Toolbox](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox).  
That is the core of this framework.  
- To use ART as a module in your project, you have to install `pip install adversarial-robustness-toolbox`
- For my ML model I use `sklearn` but you can use whatever you want
- Another important point is that you need `numba 0.54` and `numpy 1.19.5`

# TODO 📝
- [ ] Write the problems in the introduction
- [ ] Explain all sections in 1 - 2 sentences
- [x] Add log function to the framework
- [ ] Add a class for the case study
- [ ] log ART
